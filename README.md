# An ICP multiuser Ethereum wallet that can delegate access to agents

This multiuser Ethereum wallet uses allows the user to generate an Ethereum address by logging in with their Internet Identity. The user can then send and receive Ethereum to other users.

The wallet also allows the user to delegate access to an (AI) agent. The agent can then send Ethereum on behalf of the user. The user can revoke access at any time. In addition to delegating access, the user can specify som rules that the AI agent must follow when interacting with the wallet:

1. `max_transaction_amount`: Limits the maximum amount of ETH that can be transferred in a single transaction.
2. `wait_time_minutes`: Enforces a cooldown period between transactions.

This is companion project to the [ic-eliza-eth-wallet-plugin](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-eliza-eth-wallet-agent) demo plugin for the Eliza AI agent framework. The plugin allows the Eliza AI agent to interact with an Ethereum wallet deployed on the Internet Computer.

The backend consists of a Rust canister uses the [ic-alloy](https://github.com/ic-alloy) library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. The frontend is built with React and Vite.

## Project notes

At all times when interacting with canisters on the IC you should consider the
costs involved, and the fact that update calls take 2-3 seconds to complete. To
create a good user experience, this wallet uses a combination of local state and
canister calls to provide a responsive UI.

- The Ethereum address is stored in local state after the user logs in. Next
  time the user logs in, the address is retrieved from local state.
- The balance of the Ethereum address is not queried from the backend canister.
  Instead, the frontend queries the balance from an Ethereum RPC endpoint. This
  is more efficient than making a canister call.

## Setup, pre-requisites

#### Etherscan API key

An [Etherscan API key](https://etherscan.io/apis) is required to query the wallet ETH balance. Creating an Etherscan account is free.

Save the API key to a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project:

```bash
echo "VITE_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY" > .env.local
```

## Setup, dev environment

There are two main ways to set up the dev environment:

### 1. Using a VS Code Dev Container

The dev containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured
development environment. This repository includes a dev container configuration
that you can use to open the project with all the necessary tools and
dependencies pre-installed.

Pre-requisites:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

Once Docker, Visual Studio Code and the Dev Containers Extension are installed,
you can open the project in a container by clicking the button below:

[![Open locally in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-eliza-eth-wallet)

### 2. Setup manually

Pre-requisites:

- [Local Internet Computer dev environment](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/dev-env)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can clone this repository and run
the project.

## Running the project

### 1. Start the Internet Computer

```bash
dfx start --background
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### 3. Deploy the canisters

```
dfx deploy
```

## Develop

During development, you can run the frontend with hot reloading using Vite.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Backend canister methods

### `get_address`

Get the Ethereum address for the calling principal or for the principal
specified in the call parameters.

Call signature:

```
get_address: (owner: opt principal) → (variant {Ok:text; Err:text})
```

Get the Ethereum address for the calling principal:

```bash
dfx canister call backend get_address
```

Get the Ethereum address for a specified principal:

```bash
dfx canister call backend get_address '(opt principal "hkroy-sm7vs-yyjs7-ekppe-qqnwx-hm4zf-n7ybs-titsi-k6e3k-ucuiu-uqe")'
```

### `get_balance`

Returns the ETH balance of the Ethereum address controlled by a principal.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Making update calls to the backend canister comes with a small cost in cycles.
> And it takes a bit of time. Once the frontend has knowledge about the Ethereum
> address, it is more efficient to query the balance directly from an Ethereum
> RPC endpoint outside of the IC.

Call signature:

```
get_balance: (owner: opt principal) → (variant {Ok:text; Err:text})
```

Get the ETH balance for the calling principal:

```bash
dfx canister call backend get_balance
```

Get the ETH balance for a specified principal:

```bash
dfx canister call backend get_balance '(opt principal "hkroy-sm7vs-yyjs7-ekppe-qqnwx-hm4zf-n7ybs-titsi-k6e3k-ucuiu-uqe")'
```

### `send_eth`

Sends ETH from the Ethereum controlled by the calling principal to any
recipient.

Call signature:

```
send_eth : (to: text, amount: Wei) -> (variant {Ok:text; Err:text});
```

Send ETH by specifying receiver address and ETH amount (in wei):

```bash
dfx canister call backend send_eth '("0xa32aECda752cF4EF89956e83d60C04835d4FA867", 1)'
```
